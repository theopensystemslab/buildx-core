# Future

## Branches worth re-visiting

- [threebox for 3d buildings map in site](https://github.com/theopensystemslab/buildx-reloaded/tree/xp-threebox-24)
  - seems to run!
  - conflict with r3f (threebox wants to ship its wrapped Three.js)
  - threebox is opinionated on gestures
- [OpenAI Whisper + ChatGPT API voice inference commands](https://github.com/theopensystemslab/buildx-reloaded/tree/xp-whisper-gpt-updates)

## The Context Menu

- Separate React vs. Vanilla JS interfaces?
  - app vs. core separation good first step
  - would be nice to make it super agnostic
    - (doesn't care about react/vue/whatever)
    - headless talky back and forth thing

---

# Layouts

- currently just column layouts
- could support other kinds of layouts?
  - expect other dnas conditions?

---

# More OffscreenCanvas?
